# School_District_Analysis
Academic performance on a small sample (15) of district and charter schools

##Overview
On this project we'll be going through the reading and math scores of schools in the district with the purpose of evaluating their testing proficiency. Also

Each school's type (charter or district), size (small - large) and budget (via per capita spending) will be used in our analysis to establish the relationship they hold with student performance.

Scores by School Spending (per capita spending)
- The lowest range or 'bin' ($ 0 - $ 584) had the highest overall passing percentage, showing that the money spent on a student doesn't have a positive realation with their academic performance as much as, let's say, the quality of the teachers and the teaching system, as well as the administration and organization strategies from the heads of each school

Scores by school Size
- Schools tend to have a lower passing rates as well as lower averages when the student count is above 2000. The impact shows claerly in the table above, with the % Overall Passing being 58% in large size schools, compared to the 91% obtained in its medium size counterparts. Ther isn't much difference among small to medium size schools, wich could mean that a classroom with fewer students in it, could receive more attention from the staff, and teachers could take care of the details that keep alumni from advancing in each subject, thus overcoming the challenges presented to them on a daily basis. 

Scores by school type
- The results show that Charter schools performed at a higher level on all categories (averages and overall pasing rate) but, focusing on the reading subject, the average for district shools was not that far from the charter schools average - less that 3 porcentual point -. So sure, the reading deparment needs to improve, but more attention should be put on the math department, with an average as low as 76% no wonder only 66% of alumi accomplished a passing score, this number should be at least the same as the % passing reading (80%).

- I think, the analysis accounts for the advantages that come with the freedom or "flexibility" in  the operation of a charter school. They take greater responsability by not adhering to all regulations applied to district school, and deliver great results. A particular system may not work for every student, and not all charter schools are the same. But, given the opportunity, a group of individuals (teachers, administration staff) could take on the challenge of improving the way teaching is presented, bring clarity to the learning process and conrtibute to developing the mind on each student that they can.  

Challenge deliverables were about replacing all the grades form the ninth grade at Thomas High School (due to an academic dishonest move) and replace them with NaNs. Once the task is completed, a new school summary must be done to show if there are any mayor varaitions on the results.
